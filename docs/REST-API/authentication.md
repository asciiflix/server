# Logout
To add a JWT-Token to our Blacklist simply call ``/secure/logout``. The used JWT token will be added to our blacklist to prevent further use.

# Use Secure Endpoints
If you want to access secure endpoints like ``/secure/my_status``, you will need a valid JWT-Token. <br>
No JWT-Token? -> How to get a JWT-Token, please read:

Now you can simply at the JWT-Token to your http-headers with the Key ``Token`` and the Value will be your JWT-Token. Here is an example:<br>
``Token:yourPrivatJWTToken``

Keep in mind do NOT share your private JWT-Token, the API canÂ´t block an existing token, your JWT-Token is valid until the expire time is reached.
