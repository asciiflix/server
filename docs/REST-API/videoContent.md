# Video Content
## The API-Endpoint has been updated! Now itÂ´s recommended to use the Endpoints with the VideoStats. With that Update, you can no longer get/delete VideoContent with the videoContentID, just with the regular videoID like ``bb2d47c5-b1b0-453e-ac98-b270bc5e9ee0`` 
Keep in mind the createContent and deleteContent Endpoints are behind ``/secure``, so you will need a valid JWT-Token.

# Overview

# Create VideoContent
You can upload/create a Video at the the Endpoint ``/secure/video/createContent`` with a POST request, you can upload any JSON Object/Array within the Key ``Video``. <br>
Here is an Example:
## Usage
````json
{
    "Video": {
        "Rows": [
        "______",
        "|----|",
        "|----|",
        "______"
        ],
        "height": 4,
        "width": 6
    }
}
````
## Response
You will get the VideoContentID which is really important and a message. Please save the ``_id``  to properly connect the VideoContent with VideoStats later.
````json
{
    "_id": "60c4a7a234cad8de5f2ea71c",
    "message": "Successfully created VideoContent"
}
